Sir I have too many doubts now:-

1) SIGNUP + FORGOT PASS candidate also do forgot pass )=> login option create acc option and forgot pass (right?)
2) login email ke through hoga nah?

After login yeh from open hoga nah with submit btn? {

	Name of the Applicant: <stud input>
	Application Number: <stud input>
	Email: <signup wala> AUTO FILLED
	Department Applied for: <Drop Down> A,B,C
	Designation Applied for: <Drop Down> Asst Prof, Asso Prof, Prof
	Title of the talk: <stud input> TEXT BOX
	Broad Area of Research Topic: 1 input
	Keyword 1 of research area : <stud input> TEXT BOX
	Keyword 2 of research area : <stud input> TEXT BOX
	Keyword 3 of research area : <stud input> TEXT BOX
	Keyword 4 of research area : <stud input> TEXT BOX
	
} right ? or candidate user meh bass itna hi nah? 

3) phase 2: SIGNUP only for faculty + FORGOT PASS candidate  <check email in db> also do forgot pass 
   SIGNUP ONLY FOR FAC )=> means login option create acc option and forgot pass (right?) and  email in db means what?
